                <h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 23px;">I'm a second year student here at Lewis, current majoring in Physics and Mechanical Egnineering. 
                    It's a five year course with both classes from Lewis, and The Illinois Institution of Technology. I have a ton of different interests such as 
                    programming, computer science, woodworking, playing games, watching football, science, engineering (All of the differerent types
                    ). I was born on September 11th 2000, on an army base in Wurzburg Germany. Both of my parents, as well as my brother and I are
                    PADI certified scuba divers, something I've been doing since I was 11. Last semester I lived about 10 minutes off campus in Romeoville,
                    before my parents moved to North Carolina. Since then, I live in Crest Hill and am currently employed at amazon. My brother was majoring in
                    computer science before he droped out to join the navy. In the past couple of years he got married and had a boy with his wife, and is planning
                    on going back to college when he gets out.

                <h2><b>Favorite Hobby</b></h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">I have quite a few different hobbies such as woodworking, working on cars, playing games, watching football,  scuba diving,
                 as well as traveling. I got into woodworking as a freshman in high school when I took a woodworking class, and decided to take it everyyear as
                an elective. Since then, I've contiuned to work on projects on my own time to sell them. I don't have any photos of current projects, but I make
                cutting boards, pens, boxes, and bowls (If you're curious about buying something, just let me know). As I previously mentioned, I started diving when I 
                was 11, and so far I have almost 200 dives (Haven't had time to dive much lately). The last hobby I'll talk about is working on cars. Many of my friends
                are mechanics or also work on their cars, so naturally I started to become interested in them. I haven't been able to do much as my car isn't easy to 
                modify, but I have plans for a project car given I get enough money.</p>
